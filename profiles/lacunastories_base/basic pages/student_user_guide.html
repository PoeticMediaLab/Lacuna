Lacuna Stories lets you make notes on all texts, images, videos and audio, which encourages active reading and reflection. You can share your notes with the class to turn your solo reading experience into a reading community. A typical class meets once or twice a week, but Lacuna Stories doesn’t stop there -- you can continue the discussion online, developing your thoughts as you encounter new texts and building on the ideas of your classmates.&nbsp;</p><p>Lacuna Stories is a Stanford-based digital humanities project designed to improve the way we read and learn collaboratively. To learn more about the Lacuna Stories project, its history, and research goals, visit www.lacunastories.com.</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Why Should We Annotate?&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p>Annotation - taking notes as you read - is an age-old practice for making sense of texts. Annotation lets you reflect on what you’re reading as you read, which will help you understand the text more deeply. Your annotations will also make it easier for you to come back to the text later on and see what was important or what you were thinking the first time around.</p><p>Skilled readers use annotation to engage in dialogue with the author and to play with ideas. They underline key concepts and passages. They make notes to trace themes throughout the text, to ask questions of the text, or to make connections with other texts and concepts.&nbsp;</p><p>Annotations can be whatever length and style are useful for you. Not all passages will be annotated equally; as you read, certain passages will stand out as being particularly important, and it's natural to want to annotate those passages more heavily.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In Lacuna Stories, annotation takes two forms: highlighting and annotations.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Highlighting</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;can draw your attention to certain passages that you thought were particularly interesting, beautiful, funny, troubling, etc.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Annotations</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;(or notes) let you record your own questions, thoughts, ideas, and reactions to the text. All notes refer to a particular highlighted passage.</span></li></ul><p>Previous experience tells us that there are three main actions that students find useful when they make annotations on a text. Lacuna Stories lets you choose between these actions to categorize your annotations. The lines between these categories are subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules. But using them will help you think about how you read and help other students when they look at your annotations.</p><ul><li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Comment</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">: Your opinions about or immediate reactions to the text. (e.g. "Interesting!" or "I don't buy this.")</span></li><li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Question</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">: Challenging or interrogating the text. Asking about facts discussed in the text. Sparking a discussion with questions to your fellow students or the instructor.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Compare:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;Making comparisonsbetween the text and something else you've read, watched, or experienced (inside or outside the class). Connections to another part of the same text.</span></strong></li></ul><p>You can also assign&nbsp;<strong>tags</strong>&nbsp;and to your annotations in order to structure your reflections on the texts, then limit the annotations view to only show selected tags by using the Annotation Filter.</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">What Does it Mean to Read, Comment, and Learn Socially and Collaboratively?</span></strong></p><p>Your annotations on Lacuna Stories can be public or private.</p><ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">A&nbsp;</span><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">public</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;comment is viewable to you, the instructor, and your fellow students.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">A&nbsp;</span><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">private</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;comment is viewable only to you and to the instructor.</span></li></ul><p>You can change these settings at any time. For instance, you may make a provisional annotation comment, keep it private, then rewrite it after a class and make it public when you’re ready for it to be shared.&nbsp;</p><p>Annotations are, first and foremost, to help&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;reach a deeper understanding of the texts and media you’re enjoying in this course. But when you make your annotations&nbsp;<strong>public</strong>&nbsp;you are also:</p><ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Creating opportunities for conversation between you and your fellow students before class starts.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Giving your instructor(s) a better idea about what to address in class, because they can see what the class found confusing/interesting/worth discussing.</span></li></ul><p>Students who have used Lacuna Stories report that being able to read and respond to other people's annotations helped them clarify their own thoughts on their reading and made them feel closer to their peers.&nbsp;</p><p>It might feel very strange at first to feel like other people can "see" you reading. You might be worried about how your annotations compare to other students', and you might feel pressure to come up with something interesting or smart to say in every annotation. The important thing to remember is that if you're feeling that way, then so is everyone else. Plus, most students who've used Lacuna Stories report that public annotation gets more comfortable as the quarter progresses, partially because they get to know their fellow students better.</p><p>Also, discomfort is actually a sign that you’re learning. People often have to try new things many times before they become comfortable with them. Not feeling sure about your work is productive: the moment of not knowing is the moment where you can actually learn something new. One of the things we hear often at Stanford’s d.school is “fail early and fail often," because then you have a chance to reflect and improve based on feedback. The instructor is here to guide you on a learning journey and give you productive feedback, not to judge you. Same with your classmates - you’re all exploring new ideas together. We’ve tried to structure Lacuna Stories so that your reading and analysis benefit from this iterative model of co-creation.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Privacy, Research, and Informed Consent</strong></span></p><p>Lacuna Stories is part of an ongoing research project at Stanford, where we are studying how students read, share knowledge, collaborate, and shape their learning based on the platform we have built. To this end, we&nbsp;<em>anonymously</em>&nbsp;track engagement on the site to make claims such as “30% of students commented on another student’s blog post at least once a week.” The IRB form you will be asked to sign grants us permission to include your anonymous site behavior with all the other users of the site. As the consent form indicates, if at any point you would like to use Lacuna Stories but not have your anonymous site use aggregated into our research data, please email info@lacunastories.com to request your data be removed from our study.</p><p>Lacuna Stories also changes classroom dynamics: students who have taken courses using Lacuna Stories have reported a greater sense of community and shared knowledge creation. To this end, a member of the Lacuna Stories team may stop by your course to see how the platform is being used in class. We may also ask you to participate in an interview or a short survey. All of these activities will be optional and participation will not affect your grade. Just like your site data, any notes we take during observations are not linked to individuals and are completely anonymized - we work hard to protect your privacy so that you can focus on enjoying Lacuna Stories and the interactive learning it supports!&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Give Us Feedback on a Work-in-Progress!</strong></span></p><p>Students and instructors have found Lacuna Stories helpful for shared conversation and collaborative learning with course materials. But it’s still a work in progress, and with every new class we learn a little more about how our designers, developers, research team, and staff can make it even better.</p><p>There are two ways you can contact us with problems, questions, or feedback:</p><ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Found a glitch or immediate problem? Email info@lacunastories.com and cc- your instructor so we can quickly get your account running smoothly again.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Have feedback for changes, bugs, or suggestions for improvement? Post them in the Forum topic “Suggestions for Lacuna Stories Improvement.”</span></li></ol><p>Thanks for your participation and feedback! Remember that Lacuna Stories is cutting-edge stuff - and that you’re helping us get it ready for wider use in the future.</p>
