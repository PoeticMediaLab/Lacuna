The Poetic Media Lab at Stanford is actively developing the platform to support the core elements of a college-level humanities or seminar-style course: reading, discussion, and writing.&nbsp;</p><p>The first priority of Lacuna Stories is to take advantage of digital texts to put more tools at the disposal of faculty and learners. A built-in annotation tool encourages students to actively engage with texts, videos, and images and reflect as they read (or watch, or listen). Instructors can see in advance of class which students have done the reading and how they engaged with it. Students can share their annotations with one another, which allows conversations directly on the text. The webspace also has tools for students to publish their writing and respond to what others have written.&nbsp;</p><p>Lacuna Stories is designed to help instructors and students explore innovative reading and writing assignments, classroom activities, and discussion strategies -- all of which take advantage of the unique features of a digital space. Lacuna Stories enables:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Reading Individually</strong></em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">&nbsp;Lacuna Stories lets students annotate all texts, images, videos and audio, which encourages active reading and reflection in advance of class.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Comparison and Synthesis Across Media</strong></em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">&nbsp;The Sewing Kit lets students view and connect their quotes and annotations from multiple texts.</span></p><p><em><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Reading Together&nbsp;</strong></em>Students<span style="line-height: 1.538em;">&nbsp;can share their annotations with the class to turn a solo reading experience into a reading community. Instructors can share annotations to guide students’ reading. Seminars work because everyone shares ideas, but a typical seminar is only three hours per week. Lacuna Stories extends the seminar space into cyberspace.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Visible Learner Activity</strong></em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">&nbsp;Instructors can use the Dashboard for a summary of students’ reading patterns and view all of the notes that students make on the text. Or they can go directly to the text and explore what students have marked up. &nbsp;</span></p><p><em><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Enhanced Class Discussion</strong></em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">&nbsp;Instructors and students can prepare for discussion by looking at others’ comments in advance. Annotations can be added live during class as a record of the discussion.</span></p><p><em><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Integrating Writing and Reading</strong></em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">&nbsp;The writing tool can be used for blog posts or final papers, encouraging your students to reflect on genre, style, and audience. Writing responses can be annotated and linked to related materials, in order to visualize connections between the words and ideas of authors and students.</span></p></blockquote><h3>Running a Course with Lacuna Stories</h3><p>Every instructor’s toolkit is different, and we hope that Lacuna Stories will become a useful part of yours. Lacuna Stories is designed to make running a humanities or seminar-style course easier — by ensuring that everyone has access to the texts, by putting reading at home on a social footing , and so forth — but it has the potential to do a lot more than that. Lacuna Stories gives its users the freedom to reimagine the humanities or seminar-style course, not so much in terms of its goals as its method — the assignments, evaluation, and feedback that make up the day-to-day.</p><p>This guide starts by describing the basic features of Lacuna Stories - concretely,&nbsp;<a href="#WDLSD">what can the software do</a>? Then, it provides some guiding questions for planning your course in terms of&nbsp;<a href="#PLANNING">student learning outcomes</a>. Next, it goes through the activities that you and your students can do with Lacuna Stories. The&nbsp;<a href="#ANNOTATING">Annotating while Reading</a>&nbsp;section discusses strategies to encourage students to annotate while they read, as well as the benefits and challenges of personal and social annotation. The&nbsp;<a href="#ASSIGNMENTS">Assignments and Projects&nbsp;</a>section goes into detail about using annotation to encourage productive reading and thinking practices; leveraging social annotation to support critical conversations between students outside of class; and using the Sewing Kit to make comparisons across multiple texts. It also offers some brief suggestions for semester-long projects using Lacuna Stories. The&nbsp;<a href="#DISCUSSIONS">Discussions</a>&nbsp;section describes ways to use annotations to enhance discussions in and outside of class. Finally, the&nbsp;<a href="#WRITING">Writing Projects</a>&nbsp;section introduces the Lacuna Stories approach to different genres and stages of writing, and the&nbsp;<a href="#ASSESSMENT">Assessment&nbsp;</a>section discusses going beyond papers to grade and assess students based on their annotations</p><p>Each section has suggestions which we hope will give you a place to start, and inspire even more creative approaches. We’re eager to hear from you about the different ways that you find to use Lacuna Stories in your class.</p><p>Please also note that Lacuna Stories is actively under development. While we hope that this doesn’t mean there are actual bugs in the software, it does mean that there are some things it still doesn’t do, even though they are on our wishlist. There may also be some things that it should do that we haven’t even thought to put on the wishlist - and we’d love to hear from you about what those could be! Please reach out with any ideas or complaints to&nbsp;<em>info@lacunastories.com</em>.</p><h3>What Does Lacuna Stories Do?</h3><p>This section provides concrete descriptions of each of the primary features of Lacuna Stories. Suggestions for how to take advantage of these features for your teaching and assignments to students are in the following sections.</p><h4>Individual Annotation</h4><p>As humanists and long-time professional readers, we know that skilled readers use annotation to engage in dialogue with the author, to note their own reactions to the text, and to play with ideas. These are mental habits assisted and reinforced by visible, material actions. Skilled readers underline key concepts and passages. They make notes to trace themes throughout the text, to ask questions of the text, or to make connections with other texts and concepts.&nbsp;</p><p>In Lacuna Stories, we’ve broken down annotation into two actions: highlighting and annotations.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Highlighting</strong>&nbsp;can draw attention to certain passages that the reader thinks are particularly interesting, beautiful, problematic, funny, troubling, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Annotations</strong>&nbsp;let readers record questions, thoughts, ideas, and reactions to the text. All annotations (which we sometimes call ‘notes’) refer to a particular highlighted passage.</p></blockquote><p>Annotations are further broken down into multiple categories, which makes annotating on Lacuna Stories both flexible and specific. Students can effectively mark up the text as they please, but before they can add something, they are required to reflect momentarily on what exactly they are adding. The default categories on Lacuna Stories are based on our experience with pilot courses, where we observed that there are three main types of notes that students tend to make:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Comment</strong>: Opinions about or immediate reactions to the text. (e.g. "Interesting!" or "I don't buy this.")</p><p><strong>Question</strong>: Challenging or interrogating the text. Asking about facts discussed in the text. Sparking a discussion with questions to fellow students or the instructor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Compare:</strong>&nbsp;Making comparisons between the text and something else you've read, watched, or experienced (inside or outside the class). Connections to another part of the same text.</p></blockquote><p>If there is another set of categories that you want to use to encourage students to think about how they read and the types of reactions they are having to the text, it is possible to modify your course website accordingly. For example, a course that wanted students to engage in critical thinking around historical documents asked students to categorize their notes in terms of lenses that a historian would use, such as the Historical Context of the text. Each annotation has a differently colored highlight to reflect its category.</p><p><strong>Tags</strong>&nbsp;are another tool that we put at readers’ disposal in order to structure reflections on the texts. Annotations on a particular text and in the My Annotations section can be sorted and filtered by tags. Further features for using tags - e.g. tag clouds for each text - are still under development.&nbsp;</p><h4>Social Annotation</h4><p>Annotations on Lacuna Stories can be public or private. These settings are selected at the moment of making the annotation and can be changed at any time.</p><blockquote><p>A&nbsp;<strong>public annotation</strong>&nbsp;is viewable to the reader, the instructor, and the other students.</p><p>A&nbsp;<strong>private annotation</strong>&nbsp;is viewable only to the reader and to the instructor.</p></blockquote><p>Public annotations are particularly useful for dialogue around the text - either impromptu or as part of an assignment. You and your students can reply to one another’s annotations, and we are working on a way to integrate this process smoothly into reading. But for now, you will need to follow these steps: mouse over the highlighted passage, and then move your mouse to the hovering annotation. In the top right of this box, a link symbol will appear - click on this (it will get dark and the mouseover will say “View as Webpage) and then you will be sent to a page where you can comment on the annotation, as if it is a thread in a discussion forum.&nbsp;</p><h4>Connections with the Sewing Kit</h4><p>Finding patterns across and within texts is a central practice of scholarly inquiry. We often hope that our students are putting texts in conversation with one another, but these connections are typically made explicit only in papers or in class discussions. The Sewing Kit makes these connections visible, and potentially less high-stakes and thus more exploratory. Instead of holding a set of possible connections in their heads, or flipping back and forth between different texts, the Sewing Kit lets students and instructors “stitch” together excerpts, annotations, and materials into collections called “Threads.”&nbsp;</p><p>To link notes and materials, go to <strong>Connect</strong>--&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Sewing Kit,</strong>&nbsp;and select the annotations and excerpts that you want to link together. You can link these materials together in a New Thread, or you can add them to an existing thread.&nbsp;If you start a new Thread, you’ll be asked to write a description, which can be edited at any point later on.&nbsp;To view Threads made by yourself and others, go to <strong>Connect</strong>--&gt;&nbsp;<strong>My Threads</strong>.</p><p>The Sewing Kit can be used as a playful brainstorming space, where students can experiment with making connections at any point in the course. These Threads can be used to as the backbone of future final papers. The Sewing Kit can also be used for formal assignments that are structured differently than a traditional paper, as discussed in&nbsp;<a href="#ASSIGNMENTS">Assignments.</a></p><h4>Writing Responses &nbsp;</h4><p>In addition to the Sewing Kit, students will also find “Write a Response” under the “Create” tab. Clicking on “Write a Response” will take them to a page where they can create a blog post. In addition to the actual post, the writing interface requires students to provide a title and a visual icon, and to tag the post by Topic and Genre. The topics provided are tailored by you as the instructor to the particular course you are teaching, but they will generally be quite broad, i.e. “Art,” “Literature,” “Politics.” Students may also tag their post with other tags they may be using, and stitch their post together with other posts and annotations through the Sewing Kit.</p><p>It’s important to note that students can always change the privacy settings on a blog post. Students are welcome to write their early drafts of papers on Lacuna Stories directly, and then simply save the post rather than publishing it immediately. Students can also use the My Writing section for taking notes in class. Some instructors have chosen to do in-class writing assignments on Lacuna Stories, particularly if their students are initially hesitant about posting on their own. But it is up to you whether to ask students to publish their writing immediately. Some of them may prefer to revisit their writing before making it public to their instructor and classmates.&nbsp;</p><p>At the very bottom of the Response page, you will find a text box labeled “Bibliographic Reference.” If students begin typing the title of a text on the course site into the box, Lacuna Stories will suggest texts to them; once they select a text, it will be automatically linked to from the student’s blog post, so that whoever reads the student’s post can go directly to the source material. These connections can be visualized in the Map View, as described below.</p><p>Any of these pieces of writing can be linked in a "thread" with other materials or specific annotations by using the Sewing Kit. Additionally, all pieces of published writing become annotatable, just like the course materials. So you or your students can annotate one another’s writing, for purposes of feedback or criticism.</p><h4>Instructor Dashboard&nbsp;</h4><p>The Instructor Dashboard gives you a high-level view of the number and types of annotations that students have done for each text. You can get a quick sense of what students found interesting, confusing or compelling by exploring the annotations that students have made (the “View Annotations” button). Current work is underway to add more functionality to the Instructor Dashboard, and we’ll be curious to hear from you what you think will be helpful.</p><p>If you choose to do assignments or assessments via annotations, you can use the Dashboard to check on students’ activity. Select the relevant dates from the Timeline and each student’s activity will be represented by pie charts of the number of annotations they have made during those dates. You can choose between seeing the number of public and private annotations students have made, the number of each category of annotation. and the number of annotations that are highlights or have a particular length.</p><h4>Map View&nbsp;</h4><p>The "Map" view provides a high-level visual summary of the connections to particular texts made in all of the Responses of the class. Students use the "Bibliographic Reference" field at the bottom of their writing screens to note these connections. This lets both students and instructors explore similarities and differences in the resources students have chosen to connect. Patterns or variations can often be illuminating to an instructor, who may wonder what aspects of the course have really caught their students’ minds and imaginations.</p><h3>Planning Your Course: Student Learning Outcomes</h3><p>Course planning on Lacuna Stories is guided by the principle, supported by current pedagogical research, that effective teaching stems from understanding and designing for the learning outcomes for your course. In other words, what skills or knowledge do you hope your students will have at the end of the term? Ideally, everything you do in class and on Lacuna Stories with your students will tie into your particular learning outcomes. You can choose to leverage different features of the platform based on the learning outcomes that you’ve articulated and prioritized. Throughout this guide, our suggestions for assignments often use this logic and phrase activities in terms of learning outcomes.</p><p>The guiding questions below will help you reflect on your desired learning outcomes.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Focus on Your Students</strong></h4><p>When you are considering learning outcomes for a course, it is important to think about who your students are, what they will bring to your course, and what their own learning goals may be. Here are some questions to consider:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Who are the students?</strong>&nbsp;Are they freshmen? Advanced undergraduates majoring in your field? Graduate students?</p><p><strong>Why will they take your course?</strong>&nbsp;For a general education requirement? For a major requirement? Is it a prereq for anything?</p><p><strong>What pre-existing knowledge</strong>&nbsp;will they bring to bear in your course? Is it part of a sequence? What can students be expected to know? What shouldn’t they be expected to know?</p><p><strong>What intellectual practices</strong>&nbsp;will students bring to your class? How are they likely to approach a text, write a paper, or analyze sources? Are they likely to be collaborative or singular in their approach to their work?</p></blockquote><h4>Focus on Learning and Praxis Outcomes</h4><p>Once you’ve answered these questions about your students as thoroughly as possible, you are ready to think about specific learning outcomes you wish them to have at the end of the course. Notice the emphasis on students demonstrating their skills and content mastery - learning outcomes should be as concrete as possible to help you systematically evaluate your students’ work and choose between multiple possible activities when you are planning your course.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What will students be able to do</strong>&nbsp;at the end of your course or course sequence? In other words, what content and skills do you want them to have mastered?</p><p><strong>How should students be able to demonstrate</strong>&nbsp;that they have met these key learning goals? How will you recognize their mastery of the content and skills you wish them to have?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h4>Focus on Technology and Pedagogy</h4><p>Your detailed articulation of learning outcomes should guide the format and content of activities, assignments, and projects. For example, if your focus is writing skills, the Responses feature will likely be heavily used in your class. If you want students to demonstrate the command of a particular critical vocabulary when reading, think about how to they can use annotations to employ this vocabulary in a way that will be visible to you.</p><blockquote><p>Which features of Lacuna Stories will best help students practice and demonstrate the learning and praxis outcomes you’ve articulated?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h4>Assessment, Grading, and Feedback</h4><p>Before we move on to discussing particular activities supported by Lacuna Stories, it is important to note that activities and assignments need not always lead to a grade, even if you choose to assess them. Rather, assessment for some types of activities may be more about giving students feedback on their thinking or helping them (and you) prepare for class discussion more effectively. For more information on how Lacuna Stories can be leveraged for innovative grading, please see the&nbsp;<a href="#ASSESSMENT">Assessment</a>&nbsp;section.&nbsp;</p><h3>Annotating While Reading</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Read these two stories and these two pieces of criticism for the next class.”&nbsp;</em></p><p>Read&nbsp;<em>how</em>? We have implicit assumptions about what we want our students to be doing as they read. Marking up texts -- annotation -- is usually on that list, as an essential tool for an engaged reader and thinker. We hope that our students are engaging in these practices as well, but normally it’s difficult to tell. Often we know if they&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;the reading by answers to direct questions about plot or characters, by comments they make in class, or by time- and labor-intensive reading quizzes or summary response papers. High-quality comments are taken as a sign that they read well. But what about students who don’t speak up (particularly in larger courses)? And what about those who are talented at speaking off the cuff in reaction to the class discussion, but who we suspect are not reading particularly&nbsp;<em>well</em>? How can we help them improve their reading practices?&nbsp;</p><p>In order to answer these questions, we have to be able to see how students read. We can’t get inside their heads, but we should be able to see how they engage with the text through highlighting, annotating, and notetaking. This will create possibilities for both formal and informal forms of assessment as well as reflective conversations on reading practices and deeper preparation for class discussions.&nbsp;</p><p>For students who choose to make at least some of their annotations public, reading becomes a social or even performative activity. This makes certain learning outcomes and activities possible for the very first time, but it is important to remain aware of the way that reading changes for students when it becomes a social rather than a solipsistic activity. The Social Annotation section and the&nbsp;<a href="#STUDENTGUIDE">student handout&nbsp;</a>go into more detail about the discomfort that students may have as they are seen reading and how you might address this in your course.</p><h4>Encouraging Annotation through Conversation, Modeling and Reflection</h4><p>The simplest thing to do with Lacuna Stories is to use it as a course reader, giving students complete freedom about whether and how to annotate. But if you want to take advantage of the tool, it can be useful to require a minimum number of annotations per week. We discuss this further in&nbsp;<a href="#ASSIGNMENTS">Assignments and Projects&nbsp;</a>below.</p><p>To help student see the value of annotations, we suggest early and ongoing conversations about the value of annotating text. Soliciting students’ views on what is useful for them while reading - both in their own annotations and those of other students - can be useful to co-create expectations and a shared vocabulary for productive engagement with texts.</p><p><strong>Why annotate?</strong>&nbsp;On the first day of class, we like to ask students to share their current reading and annotation practices, and then distribute the “Why Annotate?” student handout to further clarify the value of annotation and the features of Lacuna Stories. Throughout the class, check in with your students about the ways that annotation is helping them -- or making it harder for them to read. Try not to just talk about whether or not they did annotations, but go deeper into which annotations you’ve read that were exemplary and those that could be more productive with just a little more time and thought.</p><p><strong>Model, feedback and reflection</strong>. You may be comfortable with students making annotations like “Interesting” or “Weird”, because this is an indication that they are engaging emotionally with the text. Or you can encourage students to go beyond these reactions to be more analytical and explain why the passage is interesting, or what they found unsettling about it.&nbsp;</p><p>This can depend on the course and your expectations for your students, which you can share in a number of ways. Marking up a text to provide model annotations can be useful to give learners a sense of what a productive annotation looks like to you. You can give feedback by replying directly to an individual’s annotation, through a class discussion, or through a Sewing Kit Thread that you share with the class that describes productive and unproductive annotations. You can also do a class reflection activity where each student annotates a shared text, and then have students give each other feedback on the content and usefulness of the notes that they have made.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reflecting on Categories</strong>. Students can Question, Analyze, Comment, or Connect with their notes -- or use the categories that you have chosen as an instructor. The lines between these categories are subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules. Ongoing conversations with your students about the categories can be a helpful way to reflect on reading practices as a group. For example, you could explore the ways that particular types of comment are useful for comprehension, brainstorming, or preparing for discussion. You can also encourage students to use all four categories as different ways of engaging with the material -- we share some ideas about this in&nbsp;<a href="#ASSIGNMENTS">Assignments</a>.</p><p><strong>Using Tags.</strong>&nbsp;The tags and colors can mean whatever the reader wants. Tags are useful for finding themes later on. Developing a shared list of tags can be an informative class-wide exercise that helps the group converge on a set of themes they are seeing in the texts and allows you, as the instructor, to emphasize particular ideas or concepts.&nbsp;</p><h4>Social Annotation</h4><p>Reading has historically been a private act, especially since the advent of the printing press. Annotation, likewise, is often in the margins of an individually-owned book or PDF, remaining unseen for everyone else. This creates a lot of freedom to use shorthand and references that others may not understand, and put tentative ideas down to be expanded, discarded, or laughed over later. But one of the advantages of reading in a shared webspace is that everyone is looking at the same copy of the text - which means that it is possible to see and learn from others’ annotations.</p><p>Annotations on Lacuna Stories can be public or private. These settings can be changed at any time.</p><blockquote><p>A&nbsp;<strong>public comment</strong>&nbsp;is viewable to the reader, the instructor, and the other students.</p><p>A&nbsp;<strong>private comment</strong>&nbsp;is viewable only to the reader and to the instructor.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;Just as it’s important to have conversations in order to develop a group understanding of the value of annotating, it’s important to discuss the value of social annotation -- and to acknowledge the discomfort that students may feel in being “seen” reading. We suggest giving students opportunities to voice their concerns at the beginning of the course, and that you check in with them after a few weeks to see how they are feeling. The&nbsp;<a href="#STUDENTGUIDE">student handout&nbsp;</a>discusses these issues as well.</p><p>Our students who have used Lacuna Stories report that being able to read and respond to other people's annotations helped them clarify their own thoughts on their reading and made them feel closer to their peers -- but also say that this was something that grew more comfortable over time, and was helped by getting to know their fellow students better through class discussions. Less advanced students have reported learning a great deal from the annotations of their more advanced peers, and students of all levels have reported that seeing each other’s annotations have helped them better understand where their fellow students are coming from during live discussion. At the same time, many students, but particularly advanced students, have reported feeling pressure to make their annotations “good” or interesting, not only for the instructor but also for their peers. It is therefore important to make clear to students that the discomfort that comes from annotating publicly is actually a productive discomfort: It is the discomfort that comes from pushing themselves intellectually.&nbsp;</p><p>Before class, you can use social annotations to see the “hot spots” in the text, where many students have annotated. These are likely to be areas that students found interesting or difficult while reading. By allowing instructors and students to collectively share what parts of the readings are particularly rich, problematic, or relevant to the course goals, the humanities and seminar-style classroom can immediately begin tackling shared questions and themes. This is addressed further in the&nbsp;<a href="#DISCUSSIONS">Discussions&nbsp;</a>section, below.</p><h3>Assignments and Projects</h3><p>The Lacuna Stories platform opens up a wealth of new possibilities for reading assignments, and it makes it easier to conduct the types of assignments that creative instructors have always relied on. What follows is just a handful of ideas that we’ve come up with using Lacuna Stories to support the development of core critical thinking skills. But we hope that you won’t limit yourself to these —and that you’ll share ideas of your own.</p><h4>Annotations to Guide Reading: Be Explicit and Consider Your Goals</h4><p>Choose a minimum number of annotations that best supports the reading goals you have for your students. We’ve found that a minimum 5-10 notes and highlights per text is comfortable for students, but you should pick a number that seems right to you and let us know how it goes. Generally it’s better to have fewer required annotations, and let students start to see the value for themselves and choose to annotate more, rather than have a very high number, which can distract them from reading if they are more focused on achieving the requisite count. This has proved to be particularly true for students who do not have a habit of annotation.&nbsp;</p><p>You can be specific about what types of annotations they should be. Distinguish between highlights and notes, and between note categories, to guide your students towards particular types of reading. For example:</p><blockquote><p>If your primary goal is to be sure that learners read the full text, you can ask them to highlight at least 10 (or more) important parts of the text.</p><p>If you are seeking generative questions to help prompt rich class discussion, blog posts, or early ideas for essay topics, you can specify a minimum number of Questions for each night’s reading</p><p>If you want students to focus on textual interpretations, you can ask students to Analyze at least four (or more) passages, explaining that Analyzing often goes beyond naming what’s taking place in the text to includes an explanatory how or why. For example: “This is a light metaphor . . . which works to change our approach to the main character.”</p></blockquote><p>In addition to guiding reading broadly, annotations can be used for particular types of reading assignments. Some general examples include:</p><ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Recognizing particular literary devices or themes (“Pick five examples of anaphora.”; “How does this author represent gender?”; “Highlight logical fallacies in this persuasive essay.”) Ask students to use tags to label the device or theme, in addition to any commentary they are adding in the notes.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Assigning a blog post in which students translate the style of one writer into the style of another (e.g. from Woolf to Isherwood), then asking students to reflect on the nuances of the style differences.</span></li></ol><p>You can also guide reading and engage in dialogue with your students via annotations. In our pilot courses and through student surveys and interviews, we have learned that many students -- especially non-majors in the course -- feel anxious about the professor selecting a “random” line from a work and asking the class to analyze it. The feeling of being “cold called” on interpretation can be relieved, at times, by letting students know in advance which lines or parts of a text you may want them to think about before class.&nbsp;</p><p>Leave annotations to pose questions or highlight particular areas of the text you would like students to focus on, or take special notice of, in the course readings. Be sure your students know you have done this so they can filter the annotations by your username.</p><h4>Negotiating Annotations</h4><p>Students using Lacuna Stories are building their own critical apparatus. They’re not only interacting with primary texts; they’re reading each other’s annotations, crafting rebuttals, citing primary and secondary sources. Every day the course ecosystem grows more elaborate in tangible ways. This leads to an interesting avenue for assignments involving annotations.&nbsp;</p><p>These assignments might target students’ ability to construct arguments using evidence, find a common thread among many different sources, or engage in debate.</p><p>Some ideas for assignments involving annotations include:</p><p>Use the types of notes built into Lacuna Stories to elaborate upon another student’s annotation. For example, continue and expand another student’s “Comment” annotation to make it more of an “Analyze” category. Currently, the best way to do this is by replying to the individual’s annotation; though you can also highlight the same section and put a new annotation in the Analyze category.</p><ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Select three of your classmates’ annotations and explain how they were useful, or how they altered your understanding of the text. We’re working on a way to make it easy for students to string together other students’ annotations, but for now there is a lo-fi way to make this work: students can directly annotate their classmates’ annotations (explaining why they were helpful, for example), and the latter will then show up among the student’s other annotations.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Write a blog post in response to your classmates’ annotation(s). Choose an annotation - theirs or another student’s - and use it to craft a more elaborate argument about the text. Or they can choose an annotation and take issue with it (in a constructive way, of course). If you have a Teaching Assistant, this can also be a productive way for them to lead a student inquiry-based section and begin by grouping together themes and clusters of concerns students showed in their notes.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">If the class atmosphere is especially collegial, you might try choosing a classmate’s annotation and constructing a counterargument.</span></li><li>A similar assignment might require students to choose three or four conflicting annotations that multiple readers have made and try to resolve or elucidate the issues that separate them.</li></ol><h4>Synthesizing</h4><p>Lacuna Stories also makes it easier for students to make comparisons across multiple texts. The My Annotations tab shows students all of their annotations, which means that students can look at their work on the platform as a whole and spot common themes and devices. Currently, annotations can be sorted by tags, and we are actively working on more features to allow for other types of sorting, organizing, and linking of notes. To focus on comparison across comparing across many texts, some potential assignments are:</p><ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Using color codes or tags (e.g. “Metonymy”), tie together five passages from five different texts around one theme or device. This can be prompted in advance by asking students to start using tags across texts to draw thematic, stylistic, or content connections. Annotations can also be edited to include new tags if students start to discover cross-text themes later in the course.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Focus on one passage in the primary text and tie it to five passages in secondary texts. This can be done using tags or the Sewing Kit.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Using the Sewing Kit, ask students to select or make at least five annotations and trace a theme, device, or argument across a text (e.g. “Urban life versus rural life”).</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Write a blog post elucidating one theme or device that ties together five of your classmates’ blog posts.</span></li></ol><h4>Long-Term Projects</h4><p>Lacuna Stories can also be a launchpad for larger, semester-long projects. These assignments might not look that very different from the work seminar students usually do, but Lacuna Stories makes it easier to assign parts and work collaboratively. In a seminar on De Tocqueville’s&nbsp;<em>Democracy in America</em>, for example, students might work over the course of the semester on refining their annotations and using them to craft a “critical edition” of the text. Or, in a seminar on Italian Futurism, students might create an extensive wiki including primary sources and their own interpretive work. In foreign-language literary seminars, students might work together to produce translations.</p><p>These assignments might take any number of directions — the important thing is that Lacuna Stories lowers the administrative, software, and implementation barriers that such projects usually bring with them. More than ever students expect to finish the semester having made something that can be sent out into the world, and Lacuna Stories makes it easier for teachers to build such projects into their courses.</p><h3>Discussions</h3><p>Lacuna Stories lets instructors know beforehand what students will be prepared to discuss, and allows instructors to incorporate students’ work into the discussion itself. A 3-hour, weekly seminar often includes a full hour dedicated to summarizing the reading and giving everyone a chance to speak, an opportunity students often use regardless of the relevance of their comment to the broader discussion. From the instructor’s perspective, this has been the method for assessing 1) whether students did the reading (instructor asks plot questions), and 2) whether students, at least minimally, engaged with the reading (student questions and comments).&nbsp;</p><p>With Lacuna Stories, instructors can recuperate this hour by logging on to Lacuna Stories in advance of class and seeing the texts students read and the annotations they made, which allows you to identify “hot spots” in the text that are ripe for discussion. (Use the Instructor Dashboard for this) In the courses we’ve taught with Lacuna Stories, this has freed us from previously experienced pedagogical mysteries such as “I wonder why that question flopped?” or “I had no idea they would be so interested in that part of the reading!”&nbsp;</p><p>Below are some ideas for using Lacuna Stories to generate and propel strong class discussions, as well as some ideas for classroom activities relying on Lacuna Stories. Most of these would benefit from projecting Lacuna Stories onto a screen in class so there is a shared reference for everyone, but this is not absolutely necessary if you do not have the appropriate equipment.</p><h4>Generating Discussions</h4><ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Choose three compelling annotations and, at the beginning of discussion, talk briefly about the issues they raise. We’re working on adding this ability to the Sewing Kit, but for now you might try copying and pasting annotations to a powerpoint slide and displaying them for the class. The important thing is to show students that their annotations are generating discussion.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">What parts of the text have drawn the most annotations? Ask students as a class or in small groups to summarize annotations or elucidate the issues raised by conflicting annotations.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Group students’ annotations according to theme or question and ask students, in small groups, to outline the connections between them. You can use the filter to show only annotations with a particular tag or those that fall into a particular category.</span></li></ul><h4>Classroom Activities</h4><ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">“Live annotating”</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Have students outline the essential elements of the text — plot, characters, setting, etc.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Assign one or two students to capture the class’ discussion on particular aspects of the text. A class notetaker can also use the blog function to take text notes.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Ask students to find examples in the text of particular themes or ideas - one of our instructors, teaching a Science Fiction course, asked students to look for examples of “cityscape” and “cyberspace” across multiple texts, by annotating and tagging those sections of the text</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">When a student makes a generative comment on a part of the text, ask them to immediately add it as a public note, and as a class you can determine which category or text tags would be helpful to associate with it.</span></li></ul><h4>Online Discussions&nbsp;</h4><p>As many teachers know from experience, and as educational researchers have repeatedly shown, forums on platforms like Blackboard typically fail to catch on — students post because they’re required to, but they don’t necessarily read each other’s posts or respond to them, and they almost never find these sites or the content they produce useful enough to log on and refer back to them after the course has finished. Given this experience, we have decided to eliminate discussion forums entirely from Lacuna Stories, and encourage students to have conversations either on the text - through annotations and the reply-to-annotations function - or via their Response writing.</p><p>Creating an environment that encourages online participation will be a unique challenge in every classroom. However, the fact that Lacuna Stories has all of its content in one space makes it easier to encourage online discussions around reading and classroom topics.</p><h3>Writing Projects</h3><p>The landscape for teaching writing in humanities courses is changing. Many classes have already moved a substantial amount of writing assignments online, whether they’re using a Blackboard-like platform, a class message board, a blog site, or a class webpage. One of the principal advantages of reading on Lacuna Stories is that all of the course materials are in one place, which can lower the overhead to writing and having conversations around the writing product. Students can see and comment on one another’s writing. All writing is annotatable, so the close reading practices that students are employing with the course materials can also be used on one another’s work. Annotation can also be used for specific, line-by-line feedback, which is useful both for paper drafts and final pieces.&nbsp;</p><p>A strong paper is grounded in specific sources and describes connections between texts. Lacuna Stories is particularly well suited for helping students make those connections in the service of of their own writing. Students may use the "Bibliographic Reference" field at the bottom of their writing screens to note these connections.</p><p>There are a few types of writing that lend themselves particularly well to the Lacuna Stories interface and tools: blog posts, reflection papers, and formal academic papers. Using Lacuna Stories for all of these types of writing encourages your students to reflect on genre, style, and audience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Blog posts:</strong>&nbsp;In our experience teaching with Lacuna Stories at Stanford, one good way to get students writing is to assign blog posts. Blog posts are often more akin to writing students do in real life. They can be less formal and thus better for discussion than polished product. The Lacuna Stories platform allows you to fine-tune the requirements for these assignments: you can, for instance, require students to post an image with their blog (we’ve found that this is an especially good way to get students thinking about what they’re trying to convey), or tag their blog entry and connect it to other students’ work.</p><p><strong>Reflection papers:</strong>&nbsp;A reflection paper generally sits between a blog post and a final, academic paper when it comes to the formality of style and structure. Many professors ask their students to submit reflection papers in order to demonstrate that they have done the reading and are capable of thinking critically about it. Making reflection papers public can create dialogue between students in addition to the student and instructor.</p><p><strong>Formal papers:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;There’s no shortcut to a quality final paper, but Lacuna Stories does make it easier for students to get there. Not only are all of the assigned texts in one place and searchable, but all of students’ annotations are anchored to the texts as well. This means that the critical thinking students have done over the course of the semester — ideally, legwork for the final paper — never gets lost. The annotations are always right there, ready to inform some student’s next supporting point. Public annotations can help students anticipate counter-arguments and reach conclusions they otherwise wouldn’t have. And because the annotations are anchored to specific locations in the text, it’s that much easier for students to return again and again to primary sources.&nbsp;</p><p>Students can also draw on work they have done with the Sewing Kit throughout the quarter to find the ideas and excerpts they’ve tentatively linked together. If they are expanding on the basic connections they’ve made in a Thread, we suggest using multiple windows to write with: use one window or set of tabs in that window to show the linked resources in the Thread open side-by-side with a second window (the Lacuna Stories writing screen or a word processing tool). This will let students see everything you have linked while you are writing the final version of your response paper.&nbsp;</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>How to assess our students is a matter of ongoing debate in the humanities, where quantitative assessment generally isn’t possible. How do we assess critical reading, writing, and thinking? How do we as instructors determine who is truly engaging with the material and who is skating by? Ultimately, how do we measure learning, intellectual growth, and achievement in the humanities?</p><p>Traditionally, instructors in the humanities have assessed students through their writing. Although students read throughout the course, the term paper has long been the main form of assessment for a grade. As mentioned previously, assessment need not always mean grading. What is most critical for students is the opportunity to receive specific and timely feedback from their instructor. Effective instructors tend to monitor informal evidence of students’ understanding throughout the course, from their comments in discussion to their responses in reflection papers.</p><p>However, with increased visibility into the reading process, Lacuna Stories also makes it possible to assess - and grade - how students are critically engaging with a text as they read. Below are a few ideas for how annotation practices might contribute to the assessment of your students, not only for grading but also for feedback. We have chosen to focus especially on nontraditional forms of assessment made possible by the platform, though of course we expect that students in courses using Lacuna Stories will continue to produce papers, presentations, and projects.&nbsp;</p><h4>Assessing Annotations</h4><p>Instructors using Lacuna Stories have assessed students’ annotations in a variety of ways. Below are some examples, but ultimately, how you choose to assess students’ annotations (if you choose to do so at all) will be determined by your learning goals and the sorts of reading behaviors you wish to encourage in your students. For example, if critical reading is among your learning goals, then you may wish to assess not only students’ blog posts and papers, but also their annotations. If, however, your course is more focused on students’ writing or creative expression, then assessing annotations may not be indicated.</p><p><strong>1. Quantity</strong>. One way to assess students’ annotations is through quantity of annotations. Some courses, such as the Stanford “Futurity” course that piloted Lacuna Stories in Winter 2013, have had a required number of annotations per week or text. This could contribute to a student’s participation grade or exist in a separate category. Lacuna Stories provides the instructor with annotation data for each student, so it is very easy to track each student’s annotations over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Some students have expressed the feeling that requiring a certain number of annotations leads to annotating simply to annotate, rather than because they have anything interesting to say. But this method also prompts students to annotate from the very first day, and it provides some impetus for more reluctant annotators to push themselves into participating. For students using Lacuna Stories for the first time, some minimum threshold of annotations per week or per text may help them start participating.</p><p><strong>2. Quality.</strong>&nbsp;Another way to assess students’ annotations is by considering the quality of annotations. The definition of a “good” annotation will be defined at least in part by your learning outcomes, and it will therefore vary from course to course. For example, in a course where students are asked to annotate socially, a good annotation might be one that sparks discussion. But in a course where students are asked to compare themes across texts, a good annotation might connect the text at hand with one read the previous week. No matter the definition, students will benefit from having the definition of a “good” annotation clearly articulated to them at the beginning of the course.</p><p>This method rewards thoughtful annotators whose remarks contribute consistently to class discussion. Students will annotate when they feel they have something interesting to say, rather than simply because they have not yet reached that week’s minimum. However, students may also feel pressure to have something interesting to contribute with every annotation, and this is not always possible. This may lead to some students annotating less than they would otherwise.</p><p><strong>3. Use of Annotations</strong>. A third way of assessing students is on their use of annotations for the types of assignments we describe in the “Assignments and Projects” section of the Instructor’s Guidelines. This method does not focus on either quantity or quality, per se, but rather on students’ ability to negotiate and synthesize both their own and others’ annotations.&nbsp;</p><p>This method encourages and requires students to annotate publicly and to read each other’s annotations. It inherently sparks more discussion on Lacuna Stories than assessing students for either quantity or quality of their individual annotations. It also encourages students to provide thoughtful annotations, but without the pressure of feeling they are being assessed on each individual annotation. For instructors interested not only in critical reading in the traditional sense, but also in certain “twenty-first century literacies,” this method may be the one most suited to meeting those learning goals.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this is going to take some getting used to, for both you and your students. It is important to maintain a dialogue with your students about expectations from the very beginning of the course, and it may also be necessary to adjust your expectations as the course progresses. Lacuna Stories is a very flexible platform, and there are many different ways to use it productively. You may find halfway through your course that students are using it in ways that you did not expect. It is up to you to decide how or if you wish to assess them in those areas.</p><p>One further thing to keep in mind as you consider assessment using Lacuna Stories is that students, too, have learning goals. Sometimes these goals coincide with the instructor’s learning goals, but they may also be quite different. In the “Futurity” course that piloted Lacuna Stories, the instructors experimented with allowing students to choose among a variety of assessment options, thus tailoring their experiences in the course to their own learning goals and reasons for being there. Some students, particularly the more advanced humanities students, chose a traditional term paper as their main form of assessment, while others, particularly undergraduates from non-humanities fields, chose other forms. The pedagogical payoff for allowing your students to make this sort of decision can be huge, but it requires communication, the setting of clear expectations, and flexibility from both you and your students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5 style="text-align: center;">[Download PDF of Student Guide]</h5><h3 style="text-align: center;">Using Lacuna Stories to Read, Annotate, and Learn Collaboratively &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p style="text-align: center;">(Student Guide)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>What is Lacuna Stories?</h4><p>Lacuna Stories is an exploratory, interactive web of materials for you to read and annotate socially. Lacuna Stories lets you make notes on all texts, images, videos and audio, which encourages active reading and reflection. You can share your notes with the class to turn your solo reading experience into a reading community. A typical class meets once or twice a week, but Lacuna Stories doesn’t stop there -- you can continue the discussion online, developing your thoughts as you encounter new texts and building on the ideas of your classmates.&nbsp;</p><p>Lacuna Stories is a Stanford-based digital humanities project designed to improve the way we read and learn collaboratively. To learn more about the Lacuna Stories project, its history, and research goals, visit www.lacunastories.com.</p><h4>Why Should We Annotate?&nbsp;</h4><p>Annotation - taking notes as you read - is an age-old practice for making sense of texts. Annotation lets you reflect on what you’re reading as you read, which will help you understand the text more deeply. Your annotations will also make it easier for you to come back to the text later on and see what was important or what you were thinking the first time around.</p><p>Skilled readers use annotation to engage in dialogue with the author and to play with ideas. They underline key concepts and passages. They make notes to trace themes throughout the text, to ask questions of the text, or to make connections with other texts and concepts.&nbsp;</p><p>Annotations can be whatever length and style are useful for you. Not all passages will be annotated equally; as you read, certain passages will stand out as being particularly important, and it's natural to want to annotate those passages more heavily.</p><p>In Lacuna Stories, annotation takes two forms: highlighting and notes.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Highlighting</strong>&nbsp;can draw your attention to certain passages that you thought were particularly interesting, beautiful, funny, troubling, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Notes</strong>&nbsp;let you record your own questions, thoughts, ideas, and reactions to the text. All notes refer to a particular highlighted passage.</p></blockquote><p>Previous experience tells us that there are four main actions that students find useful when they make notes on a text. Lacuna Stories lets you choose between these actions to categorize your notes. The lines between these categories are subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules. But using them will help you think about how you read and help other students when they look at your annotations.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Comment</strong>: Your opinions about or immediate reactions to the text. (e.g. "Interesting!" or "I don't buy this.")</p><p><strong>Question</strong>: Challenging or interrogating the text. Asking about facts discussed in the text. Sparking a discussion with questions to your fellow students or the instructor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Analyze:</strong>&nbsp;Claims or ideas about the text that go deeper than a comment or a connection. It might be helpful to think of analysis as annotations that could help you write a paper later on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Connect</strong>: Making connections between the text and something else you've read, watched, or experienced (inside or outside the class). Connections to another part of the same text.</p></blockquote><p>You can also assign tags and color codes to your annotations in order to structure your reflections on the texts. You can use the tags and colors to mean whatever you want. In future versions of Lacuna Stories you will be able to sort your annotations by tags, but this feature is still under development.</p><h4>What Does it Mean to Read, Comment, and Learn Socially and Collaboratively?</h4><p>Your annotations on Lacuna Stories can be public or private.</p><blockquote><p>A&nbsp;<strong>public comment</strong>&nbsp;is viewable to you, the instructor, and your fellow students.</p><p>A<strong>&nbsp;private comment</strong>&nbsp;is viewable only to you and to the instructor.</p></blockquote><p>You can change these settings at any time. For instance, you may make a provisional annotation comment, keep it private, then rewrite it after a class and make it public when you’re ready for it to be shared.&nbsp;</p><p>Annotations are, first and foremost, to help you reach a deeper understanding of the texts and media you’re enjoying in this course. But when you make your annotations public you are also:</p><ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Creating opportunities for conversation between you and your fellow students before class starts.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Giving your instructor(s) a better idea about what to address in class, because they can see what the class found confusing/interesting/worth discussing.</span></li></ul><p>Students who have used Lacuna Stories report that being able to read and respond to other people's annotations helped them clarify their own thoughts on their reading and made them feel closer to their peers.&nbsp;</p><p>It might feel very strange at first to feel like other people can "see" you reading. You might be worried about how your annotations compare to other students', and you might feel pressure to come up with something interesting or smart to say in every annotation. The important thing to remember is that if you're feeling that way, then so is everyone else. Plus, most students who've used Lacuna Stories report that public annotation gets more comfortable as the quarter progresses, partially because they get to know their fellow students better.</p><p>Also, discomfort is actually a sign that you’re learning. People often have to try new things many times before they become comfortable with them. Not feeling sure about your work is productive: the moment of not knowing is the moment where you can actually learn something new. One of the things we hear often at Stanford’s d.school is “fail early and fail often," because then you have a chance to reflect and improve based on feedback. The instructor is here to guide you on a learning journey and give you productive feedback, not to judge you. Same with your classmates - you’re all exploring new ideas together. We’ve tried to structure Lacuna Stories so that your reading and analysis benefit from this iterative model of co-creation.&nbsp;</p><h4>Privacy, Research, and Informed Consent</h4><p>Lacuna Stories is part of an ongoing research project at Stanford, where we are studying how students read, share knowledge, collaborate, and shape their learning based on the platform we have built. To this end, we anonymously track engagement on the site to make claims such as “30% of users visited the forums at least once a week.” The IRB form you will be asked to sign grants us permission to include your anonymous site behavior with all the other users of the site. As the consent form indicates, if at any point you would like to use Lacuna Stories but not have your anonymous site use aggregated into our research data, please email info@lacunastories.com to request your data be removed from our study.</p><p>Lacuna Stories also changes classroom dynamics: students who have taken courses using Lacuna Stories have reported a greater sense of community and shared knowledge creation. To this end, a member of the Lacuna Stories team may stop by your course to see how the platform is being used in class. We may also ask you to participate in an interview or a short survey. All of these activities will be optional and participation will not affect your grade. Just like your site data, any notes we take during observations are not linked to individuals and are completely anonymized - we work hard to protect your privacy so that you can focus on enjoying Lacuna Stories and the interactive learning it supports!&nbsp;</p><h4>Give Us Feedback on a Work-in-Progress!</h4><p>Students and instructors have found Lacuna Stories helpful for shared conversation and collaborative learning with course materials. But it’s still a work in progress, and with every new class we learn a little more about how our designers, developers, research team, and staff can make it even better.</p><p>There are two ways you can contact us with problems, questions, or feedback:</p><ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Found a glitch or immediate problem? Email info@lacunastories.com and cc- your instructor so we can quickly get your account running smoothly again.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Have feedback for changes, bugs, or suggestions for improvement? Post them in the Forum topic “Suggestions for Lacuna Stories Improvement.”</span></li></ol><p>Thanks for your participation and feedback! Remember that Lacuna Stories is cutting-edge stuff - and that you’re helping us get it ready for wider use in the future.</p>
