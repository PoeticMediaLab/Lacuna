Our research team at Stanford University is also interested in researching and learning from how users read, annotate, and learn using the platform. As a Lacuna Stories registered user, you are invited to participate in an ongoing research study on digital annotation software platforms. To conduct this study, we gather userâ€™s anonymized data that tracks website usage and annotations. Consenting participants may also receive emails inviting them to complete surveys about their experience of the site.</p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: 24px;" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: 24px;" dir="ltr">Your anonymity is assured; only the Protocol Directors and other members of the research team will have access to your information.
