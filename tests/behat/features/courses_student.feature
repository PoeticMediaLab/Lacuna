  In order to participate in a course
  As a student
  I should be able to read course texts and responses and write responses

  Background:
    Given an "Instructor" user named "Instructor A" exists
    And an "Instructor" user named "Instructor B" exists
    # Note: the users need to exist first so authors can be assigned
    And "course" content:
      | title         | author        |
      | Course Alpha  | Instructor A  |
      | Course Beta   | Instructor B  |
    And a "Student" user named "Student A" exists
    And "Student A" is enrolled in the "Course Alpha" course
    And a "Student" user named "Student B" exists
    And "Student B" is enrolled in the "Course Beta" course
    And "response" content:
      | title       | author    | body              |
      | Response A  | Student A | Student B smells  |
      | Response B  | Student B | Student A stinks  |
    # Note: the assignment of content to a course has to come after it's been created
