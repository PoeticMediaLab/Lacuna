Upgrade instructions
--------------------
Did you change any part of the module or the library?

- If you did not change the module or the library; download the latest versions
  of the module and the library and upload them (replacing the old files).

- If you did change the module or the library; use a visual comparison tool
  (such as Winmerge or Kompare, so on) in order to compare your current copy
  with its original one (http://drupal.org/node/711944/release) find out what
  was changed and do the same to the version you are upgrading to.
  WARNING: This is for experts only!
  
- Please note that if you are upgrading from version 1.6 running update.php will
  cause error messages to appear. To resolve this go to
  "Administer" -> "Structure" -> "Blocks", click the "Configure" link for each
  Superfish block and click "Save block" button.
  

Configuring the module
----------------------
- For block-specific settings go to "Administer" -> "Structure" -> "Blocks" and
  click the "Configure" link of the Superfish block.

- For module settings go to
  "Administer" -> "Configuration" -> "User Interface" -> "Superfish".

How to style
------------
If you know CSS, even basics of it, designing won't be a big challenge.

Here are some tips and tricks:

A) Always use a DOM inspector utility (such as Firebug).

B) Set the "Menu delay" option to a very high number such as 99999999.
   This will give you enough time to work with sub-menus.

C) If you are not using the built-in styles, set the "Style" option to "None".

D) Utilise the "Simple" style as reference; add the newly-created CSS file
   either to your theme CSS or as a new CSS file under the styles directory in
   the Superfish library (probably "sites/all/libraries/superfish/style");
   putting it in the styles folder will automatically add it to the styles list 
   in the block configuration.
