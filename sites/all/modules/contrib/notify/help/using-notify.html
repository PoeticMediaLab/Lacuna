<p><em>Notify</em> is a simple, lightweight notification module. It provides e-mail notifications to subscribers about updates and changes to the Drupal web site.</p>

<p>Submit bug reports and comments via the project's 
<a target="_blank" href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/notify" title="link to issue queue">issues queue on drupal.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you enable node revisions <a target="_blank" href="http://drupal.org/node/320614" title="link to background information">node revisions</a>, the
notification e-mail will also mention the name of the last person to
edit the node.</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>This module requires a supported version of Drupal and cron to be
running.</p>


<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The administrative interface is at:
 <a href="&base_url&/admin/config/people/notify">Administer » Configuration » People » Notification settings</a>.</p>


<p>There are four tabs:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Settings</strong>: All the main options for this module.</li>
<li><strong>Defaults</strong>: Default settings for new users.</li>
<li><strong>Queue</strong>: Process and inspect the notification queue.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>: Review and alter per-user settings.</li>
</ol>

  
<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>The <strong>Settings</strong> tab allow you to configure how the module shall work.</p>

<p>You can specify how often notifications are sent, the hour to send
them (if the frequency is one day or greater), the number of failed
sends after which notifications are disabled, and the maximum number
of notifications to send out per cron run.</p>

<p>When setting how often notifications are sent, note that e-mail
updates can only happen as frequently as the cron is set to run.</p>

<p>To reset the count of failed sends to zero, look at the
notification settings in the user's profile and save it press
&#8220;Save settings&#8221; (there is no need to change anything).</p>

<p>If you check &#8220;Include updated posts in notifications&#8221;, any change to a
node or content will cause it to be included in the next notification.
Note that even minor changes, such as correcting a trivial typo or
setting or unsetting the &#8220;sticky&#8221; attribute for the node will flag it
as updated, so use this option with caution in order to avoid excess
notificatons.</p>

<p>If you check &#8220;Administrators shall be notified about unpublished
content&#8221;, users belonging to roles with the &#8220;administer nodes&#8221; and
&#8220;administer comments&#8221; permissions granted will receive notifications
about unpublished content.  This is mainly to make the module useful
to manage moderation queues.  Note that notifications about
unpublished content are only sent once.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Watchdog log level&#8221; setting lets you specify how much to log.  The
setting &#8220;All&#8221; will make a log record of every notification mail sent.
The setting &#8220;Failures+Summary&#8221; will only log failed notification
attempts. It will also insert a summary of how many sent and how many
failures at the end of each batch.  The &#8220;Failures&#8221; setting will omit the
summary.  The &#8220;Nothing&#8221; setting will turn of logging for <em>Notify</em>.


<h3>Queue</h3>

<p>The <strong>Queue</strong> tab is to process and inspect the notification queue.</p>

<p>The radio buttons below the heading &#8220;Process notification queue&#8221; has
the following meanings:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Send batch now</em>: Force sending a notification batch without waiting
   for the next cron run.  Note that if the number of notifications
   queue exceeds the maximum number of notifications to send out per
   cron run, only the maximum number is sent.  The rest will be queued
   for the next cron run or the next manual send batch (whatever
   happens first).</li>

<li><em>Truncate queue</em>: Truncate the queue of pending notifications without
   sending out any notifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>Status</em> panel gives the administrator a rough overview of the
current state of the notification queue.</p>

<p>If you tick the box &#8220;Bulk subscribe all users&#8221;, all
non-blocked users that do not already subscribe to notifications will
be subscribed with the initial settings set under the deafult tab.</p>


<h3>Defaults</h3>

<p>The checkbox under &#8220;Notification default for new users&#8221; is used as the
default value for the notification master switch on the new user
registration.  Note that this setting has no effect unless you grant
the anonymous user the right to access notify.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Initial settings panel&#8221; let you set up the initial settings that
will apply to new users registering, and to users that are enrolled in
notifications with batch subscription. These settings have no effect
on users that already have the master switch set to &#8220;Enabled&#8221;.</p>

<p>The final section under the <strong>Settings</strong> tab let you
set up notification subscriptions by node type.  Having nothing
checked defaults to making all content types available for
subscription.</p>

<h3>Users</h3>

<p>The <strong>Users</strong> tab is to review and alter per-user settings for those users
that have the master switch for notifications set to <em>Enabled</em>.</p>

<p>If you tick the box &#8220;Bulk subscribe all users&#8221;, all
non-blocked users that do not already subscribe to notifications will
be subscribed with the initial settings set under the deafult tab.</p>
