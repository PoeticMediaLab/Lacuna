by mrmarco: Allow more room for Stanford Workgroups
by mrmarco: Make module work with WebAuth General permissions
by mrmarco: Remove calls to hardcoded localhost and use $url['host'] instead.


WebAuth 6.x-2.55
------------------------------
by ksharp, mrmarco: Fixed content access restrictions with multiple workgroups


WebAuth 6.x-2.54
------------------------------
by ksharp: Fixed bug where nodes with webauth auto-login where, after being
           updated, were causing the search modules implementation of
           hook_cron to fail when run anonymously.
by ksharp: Fixed interaction between webauth auto-login and content access
           restriction to follow more restrictive path. (That is, if auto-login
           is set, user will still be automatically redirected to WebLogin, but
           content will still be restricted if the node is restricted from view
           for SUNet User role.


WebAuth 6.x-2.53
------------------------------
by ksharp: Check PHP version before setting cookies;
           PHP versions older than 5.2.0 can not set the httponly parameter.
by ksharp: Fixed cookie_domain bug in deleting post-login destination cookie.
by ksharp: Added capability to override post-login destination cookie with
           wa_dest url parameter.
by ksharp: Created webauth_login_url hook to aid in creating custom login
           links.


WebAuth 6.x-2.52
------------------------------
by ksharp: Changed step 3.e in v2.5 to "else, go to destination ''" instead of
           destination='node' in case some other module changes the front page.
by ksharp: Previously, if WMD detected that the current session was invalid
           (because of missing webauth_at cookie or expired cookie) it would
           call drupal function user_logout() which forced return to front page
           even if another node was requested via hyperlink. This has been
           corrected so the equivalent of user_logout() is now called without
           forcing a return to the front page.
by ksharp: Auto WebAuth Login and Content Access Restrictons field sets are
           now collapsed by default on content editing pages when those
           features are enabled and when the page is either for new content or
           for editiing content where those fields are unchecked.


WebAuth 6.x-2.51
------------------------------
by ksharp: Fixed a bug in post-login destination handling where post-login
           COOKIE not being updated with each new page.


WebAuth 6.x-2.5
------------------------------
by ksharp: WMD now implements its own session handler, bypassing Drupal's
           version of the PHP session handler.  This is in response to
            problems caused by caching in Drupal versions since 6.10.
by ksharp: WMD now correctly instructs browsers not to cache or store any
           web pages created for an authenticated SUNet user.
           This is also in response to caching problems.
by ksharp: Fixes a bug where the post-login URL following WebAuth login was
           sometimes incorrect. The following algorithm is now used:
           a. if the post-login destination is specified in the URL as
              destination=admin, go to the drupal admin page
           b. else, if the login is in response to an auto-login node,
              go to that node
           c. else, if a default webauth post-login destination is set,
              go to that destination
           d. else, if the 'q' parameter is set in the URL to anything but
              'user/login', go to that destination
           e. else, go to destination 'node' and let Drupal decide where to
              go (including default site post-login destination).
by ksharp: WMD now implements its database tables using the Drupal Schema
           API, allowing Drupal to store metadata about the tables.
by ksharp: The WMD installer script now responds to the Drupal update.php
           script, allowing the site administrator to simply copy the new
           version into the modules directory and run update
by ksharp: The WMD installer should now no longer produce file system error
           messages when being installed on AFS.
by ksharp: WMD now implements hook_cron to remove session data from the
           database that is over 1 day old.
by ksharp: Information in README regarding Drupal version upgrades and WMD.


WebAuth 6.x-2.42
------------------------------
by ksharp: A new feature where nodes may be set to auto-login through WebAuth
           when accessed by an anonymous user
by ksharp: A bug fix which caused an error message when WMD installed with PHP
           versions older than 5.2.0


WebAuth 6.x-2.3
------------------------------
by ksharp: Bug fix for restricted access in book pages.


WebAuth 6.x-2.2
------------------------------
by ksharp: Security updates
by ksharp: Handling of redirect headers
by ksharp: Creation of cookies when running behind proxy
by ksharp: Hiding session info from login url
by ksharp: URL-encoding of forwarded url parameters
by ksharp: Content-access-restriction feature is now disabled by default.
           Enable it at the admin/settings/webauth page.
by ksharp: The restricted-content message is now configurable at
           admin/settings/webauth


WebAuth 6.x-2.1
------------------------------
Unreleased development version.


WebAuth 6.x-2.0
------------------------------
by ksharp: Functionally equivalent to WMD v1.5 but works with Drupal 6.x.
by ksharp: No longer fixes core user.module "bug" since new authentication
           model renders it no longer a "bug".
